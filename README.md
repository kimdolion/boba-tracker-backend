## Development Process
Planning the project

## Problem Solving
### Launching the backend
I was so excited to get started on my front end that I had started out testing the examples curlscripts, saw that they were fine, then tried the nwe order curlscripts without having created routes for them. I carefully read the error messaging to get a better sense of what I was missing, then compared against the examples in the template.

### Model development
I began working on my front end and making various tweaks back and forth but the most important edit was when I had changed my location value to be an object of various key value pairs that the front end wasn't qute set up to send. I created a few orders that then had to be deleted using curlscripts

## Unsolved Problems
Location
I'm realizing it is a lot more complicated of a model and I need to also balance working the frontend forms with it before I create resources that get "corrupted".

## Stretch Goals
Implement the location model and/or integrate a maps api to better help users locate the bubble tea shops so that they are able to actually replicate an order.
